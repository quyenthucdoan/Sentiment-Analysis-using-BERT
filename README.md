# Sentiment-Analysis-using-BERT

In this project, we will introduce two BERT fine-tuning methods for the sentiment analysis problem for
Vietnamese comments, a method proposed by the BERT authors using only the [CLS] token as the inputs for an attached
feed-forward neural network, a method we have proposed, in which all output vectors are used as inputs for other
classification models. Experimental results on two datasets show that models using BERT is outperforming than other
models. In particular, in both results, our method always produces a model with better performance than the BERTbase method.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

When I work my project, i am using google colab


### Installing



## Running

Run file main.py

```
python3 main.py
```
Show application panorama have 3 buttons(NOTE, OPEN WITH FILES, PANORAMA).

Click button "NOTE" to see message before using.

Click button "OPEN WITH FILES" and choose all file input images.

Click button "PANORAMA" and wait some seconds to show window to save file result.

To compute result images fast or low depent on resolution of input images.


### Input



## Deployment

Because file .exe too big not upload on git so I upload file to my drive.

Folder .exe, download and run file main.exe
